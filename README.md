# Fish count

## Basic idea:
Fish count is a simple three round game. At the beginning of each round, the user is shown an image of the fish they must track. After this, fish rush to swim across the screen as the user tries to count the number of the specific fish they were shown. 

Thought round one was easy? Well get ready because the speed increases with each round!

## User stories:
Fish count is a one person game where the user must give input at the end of each round.

Example run through of the game:
- The user clicks the start button 
- The user sees the fish they will be tracking for the given round
- A school of fish swims across the screen 
- The user is prompted to input the number of fish they counted
- The user clicks the next button to advance to the next round
- Repeat gameplay for two more rounds (at increasing speeds)
- Get a total of correctly counted fish
